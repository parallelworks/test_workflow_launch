# test_workflow_launch
Test launch of a PW workflow.  All execution is local - no jobs are sent to remote resources.

## Tips (add more here)
## Heading 1 

1. 'integer' not 'int'
2. 'floats' must have 'values'
3. ranges (as set by 'input' flag) end up in `params.run` and command line
4. `text` not `string`
